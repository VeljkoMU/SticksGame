The rules and basic concepts of the game by Stevan Bogdanovic

The game consists of five rows with a certain number of sticks in each row.
The first row have one t\stick, the second row has two and so on.
The game is played by two players
the players take turns while playing
During a player's turn, he chooses one of the five rows and chooses how many sticks to remove from this row.
The objective of the game is to force your opponent to pick up the last stick left on the board.

Which means that the player who picks up the second-to-last stick from the board is the winner.
Players cannot skip turns and cannot pick non-existant rows.
